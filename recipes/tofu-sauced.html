    <h1>Tofu with the GOD SAUCE</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            While an uncooked brick of tofu may seem bland or even flavourless (a heretical accusation to sling towards the humble tofu),
             this recipe will change the way you percieve this simple protein. 
            The delicate nutiness that is inherent to tofu shines brightly throughout this heavily sauced dish, 
            with the sauce itself providing the main body of flavour. The soft texture of the tofu should be enhanced 
            by the interplay of the nuttiness and the intense savouriness of the sauce.
