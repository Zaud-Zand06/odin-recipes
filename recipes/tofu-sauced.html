    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            While an uncooked brick of tofu may seem bland or even flavourless (a heretical accusation to sling towards the humble tofu),
             this recipe will change the way you percieve this simple protein. 
            The delicate nutiness that is inherent to tofu shines brightly throughout this heavily sauced dish, 
            with the sauce itself providing the main body of flavour. The soft texture of the tofu should be enhanced 
            by the interplay of the nuttiness and the intense savouriness of the sauce.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p><em>Soft</em> Tofu</p><p>If you don't get soft tofu this recipe will not work.</p></li>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>Chili crisp in oil</li>
            <li>Toasted sesame oil</li>

    <h3>How to Make</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare your tofu</li>
                <p>Put your tofu block onto a plate and begin cutting into it. Cut the tofu into small ~1cm slivers.
                This will give the tofu more surface area to be covered in sauce.</p>
            <li>In a seperate bowl, mix together the soy sauce, sugar, chili crisp, sesame oil and rice wine.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some salt over your block of tofu and pour the sauce mixture over it.</li>
            <li>Top with sliced green onion and serve over rice.</li>
        </ol>
