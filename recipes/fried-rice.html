            I love fried rice so much. 
            I could write a manifesto about it here but I'll save us some time and instead blow your
            fucking socks off with this incoming fried rice recipe.

            Also don't bother asking for measurements on any of this, <strong><em>I cook this with my heart</em></strong> so 
            I can't tell you anything about how much of each ingredient I use. I just know
            what my tastes are and adjust for myself.

            <li><b>Prepare the Ingredients</b></li>
                <p>
                    This first step of preperation is arguably the most important.
                    <strong>Make sure you have day-old rice for this one.</strong> The dryness of the rice helps the 
                    individual grains stay more crispy and give it a better body when you bite into it. 
                    If you like mush, freshly cooked is fine. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finely mince the ginger and the garlic. Cut the spam into either 1 cm cubes or small strips.
                    The way you cut the spam doesn't really matter here, as long
                    as it is easy to eat.
                </p>

                <p>This is the hardest part of the recipe.</p>
                <p>Bring your pan up to a medium high and let some vegetable oil heat up in it.</p>
                <p>
                    As the oil is heating, add the spam into the pot and gently mix so the spam is all
                    seperated and coated in oil. In a few minutes the spam will begin to brown and develop a nice colour, 
                    at this point you can add the minced garlic and ginger. Sautee all these together for a couple
                    minutes before cracking in a few eggs. Break the egg yolks and let the eggs cook for a bit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Generally I add an egg per person eating, or an egg per serving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the eggs are slightly cooked you can add the rice to the pan. Break up any clumps of rice 
                    that you can see and gently stir it all together. At this point you should also crank 
                    you stove to high. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep stirring and breaking up the rice as you add some soy sauce, salt, chicken powder and msg to the rice. 
                    Be moderate with the msg, a little goes a long way in this dish. At this point 
                    you can add whatever additional spices you may want; white pepper, bbq rub, 
                    ramen powder, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the rice has been seasoned add the peas and turn off the heat. Keep stirring the peas into the rice 
                    but the residual heat should be all the peas need to cook without losing their vibrancy.
                    Now add a drizzle of seasame oil and give it one last stir before serving.
